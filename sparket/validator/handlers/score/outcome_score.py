"""Handler for scoring submissions after outcome settlement.

This handler computes Brier score, log-loss, and PSS for submissions
after the underlying market outcome is known.

Flow:
1. Receive settled outcome or poll for settled markets
2. Look up all submissions for that market
3. Get ground truth probabilities at closing
4. Compute proper scoring rules (Brier, log-loss, PSS)
5. Persist to submission_outcome_score table
